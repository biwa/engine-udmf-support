# UDMF support in engines

This page contains tables of which UDMF fields for each map element are supported by which engines. Since some engine's documentation about supported UDMF fields is not complete and/or correct these tables do not claim to be complete or correct, either. The data is generated from the engine specific documentation (see the [source-data](source-data) directory).
